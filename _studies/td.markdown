The NIDL Lab, along with Chi-Ming Chen (Translational Research and Neural Stimulation Lab) and Ed Large (Music Dynamics Lab) has received an IBaCS seed grant award  to support our efforts to build computational models of auditory processing that will incorporate neurochemistry to generate predictions of individual behavior and electrophysiology!


When you hear a sound, some populations of neurons fire in synchrony, producing an oscillation that we can measure using electroencephalography. This process depends on the chemistry of your brain, which can be measured using an MRI. We are building a computer model of this process in order to predict how individuals respond to certain sounds, based on their neurochemistry. We will also alter neurochemistry using a magnetic stimulator to test the model predictions.
