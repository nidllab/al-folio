This study is being done to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can help people learn to read in an artificial language, and whether the location of stimulation affects different components of the reading process.

To be eligible for the study you must:

- Be a native speaker of English between the ages of 18-45
- Be right-handed
- Not have a history of seizure, neurological conditions, or serious psychiatric conditions
- Not have a history of reading difficulty
- Be able to complete **4 visits (1.5-2 hours each) within a 2 week period**

## Compensation

You'll receive about &#36;200: &#36;15/hr for six 1-2 hour sessions, plus a &#36;50 bonus for completing all sessions
