@article{Hashimoto:aa,
	Abstract = {Aim A substantial portion of children and adolescents show subthreshold psychotic symptoms called psychotic experience (PE). Because PE shares its biological and environmental risk factors with psychotic spectrum disorders, parental neuroanatomical variation could reflect a heritable biological underpinning of PE that may predict an offspring's PE. Methods A total of 94 participants from 35 families without a diagnosis of major neuropsychiatric disorders were examined, including 14 mother--daughter, 17 mother--son, 12 father--daughter, and 16 father--son dyads. An offspring's PE was assessed with the Atypicality subscale of the Behavior Assessment System for Children -- 2nd Edition, Self-Report of Personality form (BASCaty). We examined correlations between voxel-by-voxel parental gray matter volume and their offspring's BASCaty score. Results Maternal cerebellar gray matter volume using voxel-based morphometry was positively correlated with their daughters' BASCaty scores. The findings were significant in a more robust approach using cerebellum-specific normalization known. We did not find significant correlation between paternal gray matter volume and BASCaty scores or between offspring gray matter volumes and their BASCaty scores. Conclusion Expanding upon parent-of-origin effects in psychosis, maternal neuroanatomical variation was associated with daughters' PE. The nature of this sex-specific intergenerational effect is unknown, but maternally transmitted genes may relate cerebellum development to PE pathogenesis.},

@article{Botvinik-Nezer:2020aa,
	Abstract = {Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2--5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.},

@article{MARKS2019116021,
	Abstract = {Learning to read transforms the brain, building on children's existing capacities for language and visuospatial processing. In particular, the development of print-speech convergence, or the spatial overlap of neural regions necessary for both auditory and visual language processing, is critical for literacy acquisition. Print-speech convergence is a universal signature of proficient reading, yet the antecedents of this convergence remain unknown. Here we examine the relationship between spoken language proficiency and the emergence of the print-speech network in beginning readers (ages 5--6). Results demonstrate that children's language proficiency, but not their early literacy skill, explains variance in their print-speech neural convergence in kindergarten. Furthermore, print-speech convergence in kindergarten predicts reading abilities one year later. These findings suggest that children's language ability is a core mechanism guiding the neural plasticity for learning to read, and extend theoretical perspectives on language and literacy acquisition across the lifespan.},
