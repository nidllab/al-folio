Dr. Roeland Hancock is the Director of the NIDL Lab and Associate Director of the Brain Imaging Research Center at the University of Connecticut. Dr. Hancock is interested in the neurobiological factors underlying individual variability in language processing and the application of new mathematical and computational techniques to understanding these processes. His current research interests include the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study neural excitability in auditory and language processing; distinguishing genetic and environmental contributions to language pathways; and developing tablet-based games for cognitive and literacy assessment. He has a Ph.D. in cognitive science from the University of Arizona, B.S. in mathematics, and was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco Department of Psychiatry and Weill Institute for Neurosciences.
