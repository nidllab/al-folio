Millions of individuals with serious mental illness do not respond to currently available treatments. It is still unclear how differences in the brain contribute to symptoms of mental illness such as memory problems, concentration difficulties and hearing voices. I study how the brain works in those who experience such symptoms and those who do not. By providing a better understanding of how the brain operates in psychiatric disease, I hope to develop improved treatments for those suffering from mental illness and provide increased access and inclusion of those historically excluded from benefitting from such scientific advancements.
