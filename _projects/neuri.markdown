Reading disorder (RD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is challenging to remediate through behavioral intervention alone. The NeuRI study (with Devin Kearns) will evaluate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)—a safe, non-invasive method of briefly altering brain activity—can increase the efficacy of behavioral reading training. Uniquely, we are using high density tDCS to precisely target reading pathways and test the specificity of tDCS for different aspects of reading.
